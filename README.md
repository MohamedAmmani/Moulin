# Moulin
Moulin (nine men's morris) is a strategy board game for two players each player has nine pieces. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus being unable to win) or leaving them without a legal move. The game proceeds in three phases: -Placing men on vacant points -Moving men to adjacent points -(optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men This project aims to build a machine based on minimax and alpha-beta algorithms with an SDL2 GUI. for more pieces of information about the game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris
